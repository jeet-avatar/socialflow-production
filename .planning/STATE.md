# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md

**Core value:** Faceless content creators run automated YouTube/social channels without appearing on camera
**Current focus:** Wave 2 — Phase 04+ (next phase to plan/execute after Wave 1 complete)

## Current Position

Phase: 01 + 02 + 03.5 complete (all merged to main via PR #1, #2, #3)
Plan: Wave 1 complete ✅
Status: PR #3 (enterprise readiness + Phase 03 tests + Seedance Studio) merged 2026-04-13. Main is clean.
Last activity: 2026-04-13 — API audit complete, PR #3 merged, local main synced to efb2302

Progress: [████████████░░░░░░░░] ~35% (Wave 1 complete, Wave 2 next)

## Completed Milestones

- Wave 1 (PR #1 + #2 + #3): Infrastructure, DB schema, enterprise readiness, 25 backend tests, Seedance Studio — all merged to main.

## Performance Metrics

- Phases planned: 10
- Plans ready: 3 (Wave 1)
- Plans backlog: 7 (Waves 2-4)

## Accumulated Context

### Architecture Decisions

- Repo: `jeet-avatar/socialflow-production` (cleaned import from meghana-techcloudpro/socialflowproject)
- ARCHITECTURE.md committed with full gap analysis (6 critical gaps, 8 important gaps)
- Wave 1 detailed plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-12-wave1-foundation.md` (1802 lines)
- Local clone: `/tmp/sf-prod/`
- Old working dir (no code): `/tmp/socialflow-final/` — ignore
- Pricing: $29 starter / $79 creator / $199 agency (DO NOT use $49 — hardcoded bug to fix in P2)

### Decisions

- [2026-04-12]: Parallel wave execution — same pattern as ArthaBuild. Phases 01/02/03 run simultaneously in git worktrees.
- [2026-04-12]: ArthaBuild rules apply — no approval gates, autonomous execution, 60% context = new window.
- [2026-04-12]: Auth: Clerk is active auth. Auth0 code is dead — remove it in Phase 02.
- [2026-04-12]: S3 bucket: `d2nbx2qjod9qta.cloudfront.net` (CloudFront) for video storage

### Pending Todos

- Phase B (backlog): Wire Higgsfield API directly for auto video generation → store in S3. In ROADMAP.md backlog.

### Blockers/Concerns

- No MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET_KEY, or other secrets in local env — tests use mocks/mongomock (by design)
- 54-call frontend API audit complete: all routes verified. video-remotion + social posting routes confirmed.
